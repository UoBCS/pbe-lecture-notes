	Since September 2004, \textbf{LAs} have been concentrating their efforts on
	producing spatial plans. The first batch of Core Strategies has been adopted and
	others are on the way, so local authorities should prepare to put their forthcoming
	spatial plans into practice through Development Management	.
	
	\textbf{Development Management} (DM) is not a new name for \textbf{Development Control}. It is part
	of the spatial planning system, so it has a different basis and it seeks to achieve
	a greater focus on sustainable and higher quality development and greater
	community benefit than under previous planning legislation. \\
	DM includes a wide number of planning activities such as
	designing, analysing, influencing, promoting, engaging, negotiating, decision-making,
	coordinating, implementation, compliance and enforcement.
